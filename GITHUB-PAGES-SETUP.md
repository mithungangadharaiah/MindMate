3. Builds the production app with `npm run build`
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages
5. Available at your HTTPS URL in ~3 minutes

### **PWA Features on GitHub Pages:**
- ✅ **HTTPS by default** (GitHub provides SSL certificate)
- ✅ **Service Worker** works (requires HTTPS ✓)
- ✅ **Offline mode** functional
- ✅ **Installable** on mobile devices
- ✅ **Push notifications** capable
- ✅ **Background sync** enabled

---

## 🎯 Your Live URLs

After deployment completes:

**Main URL (Desktop & Mobile):**
```
https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/MindMate/
```

**Direct Pages:**
- Home: `https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/MindMate/`
- Voice: `https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/MindMate/voice`
- Auto Session: `https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/MindMate/interactive-auto`

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

2. Click on latest workflow run
3. Verify both "build" and "deploy" jobs completed ✅

### **Check Pages:**
1. Go to: Settings → Pages
2. You should see: **"Your site is live at https://mithungangadharaiah.github.io/MindMate/"**

### **Test Live Site:**
1. Open the URL in your browser
2. Check:
   - ✅ Design loads correctly
   - ✅ No 404 errors in console
   - ✅ Routes work (click around)
   - ✅ PWA install prompt appears

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: GitHub Actions workflow fails**

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Make sure **Source** is set to **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from branch")
3. Check workflow logs for specific errors
4. Common fix: Re-run the workflow (Actions tab → Click workflow → Re-run jobs)

### **Issue: 404 Page Not Found**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you've enabled GitHub Pages in Settings → Pages
2. Wait 2-3 minutes after first push
3. Check that base path is `/MindMate/` in vite.config.ts ✓

### **Issue: Assets not loading (blank page)**

**Solution:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console
2. Check for CORS or 404 errors
3. Verify base path is correct in vite.config.ts
4. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

### **Issue: PWA not installable**

**Solution:**
1. Must be HTTPS ✓ (GitHub Pages provides this automatically)
2. Must visit the site first before install prompt appears
3. On iOS: Must use Safari (not Chrome)
4. Check manifest.json paths are correct ✓
5. Check service worker is registered (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)

### **Issue: Routes show 404 (e.g., /voice, /timeline)**

**Solution:**
1. This is expected with GitHub Pages and React Router
2. For now, navigate from home page using the UI
3. For full SPA routing support, we'd need a 404.html redirect trick (can add if needed)
