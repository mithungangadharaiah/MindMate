## 🔧 How It Works Now

### **Without Backend (Current State):**
When you use the app on GitHub Pages:
1. ✅ Voice sessions work perfectly
2. ✅ Data stored in browser localStorage
3. ✅ Emotional analysis uses demo mode
4. ✅ Timeline shows your entries
5. ✅ Everything saves locally
6. ⚠️ Data doesn't sync across devices
7. ⚠️ Clearing browser data will delete entries

### **With Backend (Future - Optional):**
Once you deploy the backend (see `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md`):
1. ✅ Real AI emotion analysis
2. ✅ Cloud storage
3. ✅ Multi-device sync
4. ✅ Advanced analytics
5. ✅ Better conversation AI

git push origin main
# → Triggers build → Deploys to GitHub Pages
```

### **Local Development:**
```powershell
# Frontend only (no backend needed)
cd frontend
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000

# With backend
cd backend
npm start  # → http://localhost:5000

cd frontend
npm run dev  # → http://localhost:3000
```
