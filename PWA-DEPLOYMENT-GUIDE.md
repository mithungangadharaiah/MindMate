## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Add to Home Screen" missing?**
- Must be HTTPS ✓
- On iOS: Use Safari, not Chrome
- manifest.json valid ✓
- Service worker registered ✓

**Voice not working?**
- HTTPS required for microphone ✓
- Check permissions in browser settings
- User interaction needed first

**Offline not working?**
- First visit needs network
- After first load, should work offline
- Check DevTools → Application → Cache
